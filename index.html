        <h1>The Project</h1>
        
        <h2>Theme</h2>
        
        <p>
            This project was inspired by the 2021 theme The Greater Number of the Dutch Design Week.
            Inspired by the history of this theme, I was brainstorming a lot about different perspectives to
            approach this project. But when I came across all the inspiring stories of the small cities with
            extremely strong man and women, I just knew I needed to do something with this. The theme was all
            about climate change, less waste, less production and these are things that are not even mentioned
            by the cities at all. Because it’s normal for them to produce their own food and don’t over-consume.
            All the people in the small cities were getting 90 easily and some of them even cross the 100 years
            of age. The great number of 100 was also perfectly to complete the theme around it. After some
            research it became clear to me that there’s been a lot of research done in this cities, but the
            outcome is very easy every single time. It just contains the most important things in life. Care
            about family and friends, take it easy and relax a little bit, produce your own food, drink some
            wine and more. These things are so simple, that it’s almost unbelievable it actually works.
        </p>

        <h2>Photos</h2>
        <p>
            The photos I used are amazing (if you ask me). I came across some high quality photos of 10 people
            who are in the late 90’s which I immediately used on the homepage. Those people came from the
            island in Greece which perfectly can be used for the introduction of the interface.
            <br>
            The next section - the Blue Zones world map - doesn’t contain any pictures. I wanted to set the
            focus of te map and the text that is shown on the page.
            <br>
            The page after that one contains the 9 rules of life. Every single point has a photo that’s being
            used as a reference to each specific rule. Most of them are logic, but the image can really tell the story her.
            <br>
            The last one contains a beautiful collection of photos I collected of two main characters of this story
            I chose. Because there was much to find about them, I could setup a “personal” page about them very easy.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            So enjoy the beautiful sources of great stories in this interface. Learn from the people who
            lived around 100 years old and see what you can change in your life to change it up a little bit,
            to add some more years to your life.
